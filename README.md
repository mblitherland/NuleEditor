# NuleEditor

The NuleEditor from nule.org.

This is a minimal text edito for Java that was easy to embed in other projects where writing simple scripts in Beanshell, or the like, was useful. I wrote these years and years ago, and they still get regular use, but I don't have much interest in maintaining the original website where I hosted them. So github, here you go!

I still do support these utilities, and welcome PRs for fixes and functionality, just open an issue to discuss them first.
